# Enhanced Risk-Based Mutual Fund Classification & Portfolio Recommendation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify mutual funds into **Low, Medium, High risk**
and generate portfolio recommendations for investors.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ XGBoost model for risk classification (**92% accuracy**)
- ✅ KMeans clustering with PCA for fund grouping
- ✅ Portfolio recommendation system based on investor risk profile
- ✅ Comprehensive report documenting methodology & results

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning: **Supervised (XGBoost)** + **Unsupervised (KMeans)**
- Visualization: PCA, Clustering plots, Feature Importance
